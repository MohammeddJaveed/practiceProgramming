# Practice Programming

This repository is dedicated to practicing daily coding problems to enhance problem-solving skills. By tackling different challenges, I’m continuously improving my understanding of algorithms and optimizing solutions, especially focusing on time and space complexity.

## What's Inside
- **Problem-Solving**: Aiming to refine my ability to approach and solve problems effectively.

## Goals
- Focus on optimizing solutions for time and space complexity.
- Continue building and sharing knowledge through this repository.

## What I’ve Worked On So Far:
- Find the missing element in an array
- Move all zeros to the end
- Find Min and Max in an array
- Check for Palindrome
- Rotate an array to the right
- Find two numbers that sum to a target
- Find the second largest element
- Square each array element
- Find element frequencies
- Merge two sorted arrays

## Progress
Feel free to check out my progress and solutions. I will be adding more problems and solutions regularly.
